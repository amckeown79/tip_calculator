tip_calculator

Create a file named tip_calculator.rb. Enter the following code:

puts "How much is the bill?"
bill = gets
puts "The bill is $#{bill}"

The gets method is the opposite of the puts method. It gets input from the user rather than sending output to the user.
Run this sample program. When prompted, enter a bill amount, press enter, and see what happens.
Edit this program to gets the total bill from the user, calculate the total plus a 20% tip, and output that total to the screen.
